# Freezer Inventory Automation Example

This example shows how to use a a Siri Shortcut, a Google App Script, and a Google Sheets spreadsheet to setup a home automation workflow that will allow you to manage items in a freezer inventory.

**NOTE: This example hasn't been thoroughly tested and is provided AS-IS. Use at your own risk.**

## Description

This project allows you to use a Siri Shortcut to add / remove items from a spreadsheet that is your "freezer inventory." When adding items, you provide a description and an (optional) weight for the item. It then automatically adds a row to the spreadsheet with the current date and assigns the item a numeric ID.

This ID should be recorded - I suggest by writing on the item with a marker. 

Later, to remove an item, you run the shortcut again and select the "remove" option and enter the ID of the item to remove. That's all!

## Setup

### Create the Spreadsheet

1. Create a Google Sheet spreadsheet to store the inventory items. Mine has the following columns:

	ID  | Description | Weight | Date Added | Age (Days)
	--- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------
	101 | Meatballs   | 1 lb   | 1/14/2024  | 10
	102 | Wings       | 4 lb   | 1/15/2024  | 9

  
2. Get the ID of the Google Sheet. You will find it in the URL that you use to access the spreadsheet.

	https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/**THIS-IS-THE-ID**/edit#gid=0
	
	You will need this ID in a few minutes.
	
### Set up the Google App Script Webapp
	
1. Go to the [Google App Script](https://script.google.com) site and click "Create New Project" and name it something appropriate like "Freezer Inventory Webapp."
2. The interface will show you a Code.gs file that contains placeholder code. Replace everything in that file with the code from [the Code.gs file in this project](https://github.com/josemonkey/freezer-inventory-example/blob/main/Code.gs).
3. Find the function called getDataSheet_() near the bottom of the file and replace "THIS-IS-THE-ID" with the spreadsheet ID from the previous step.

	```
	function getDataSheet_() {
  		return SpreadsheetApp
    		.openById("THIS-IS-THE-ID")
    		.getSheetByName('Sheet1');
	}
	```
	
### Run the Script to Grant Permissions

1. Use the App Script interface to execute the doPost() function. It will generate errors since it's not being invoked correctly (by passing parameters in a web request), but this step should be done simply to get it to ask you whether or not you wish to grant the app script access to the spreadsheet.

	Read everything carefully, and agree to everything to grant access. (Or, if you're not comfortable, don't and stop here!)
	
2. The function should run and produce errors - probably something like "Invalid action." This is normal.

### Deploy the Script as a Webapp

In order for this script to be able to listen in to incoming web requests (like from your Siri Shortcut), you will need to deploy it as a webapp.

1. In the app script window, click "Deploy" in the upper right corner and select "New Deployment."
2. Under "Select Type," choose "Web App."
3. Enter a description and under "Who has access" select "Anyone." 

	**NOTE: This means anyone can execute this webapp if they know the URL. Do not do this if you're not ok with that.**

4. You will now need to grant the webapp access as well. Again, confirm this access if you're ok with that. (Or don't! You can stop at any time! ü§™)

5.  Once it is deployed, you will get a confirmation screen that tells you the webapp ID and URL. We will need this for our Siri Shortcut. Copy the URL and hold on to it.

### Set up your Siri Shortcut
I haven't shared the shortcut to iCloud, so you're going to need to configure this part manually.

Here is a screen shot. (It's from the MacOS interface, but you can do it on your phone - it's essentially the same.)

**NOTE: You must change the text "YOUR\_WEBAPP\_ID" to the web app ID that you generated in the last step!**

### Run the shortcut!

That's it! Try running the shortcut to add something to the inventory. You should get a confirmation message with the new item ID. You can then verify that you see it in the spreadsheet.

You can also remove the item you just added by running the shortcut again and selecting the "remove" option. When you do, enter the ID it gave you when you added the item.

## Closing Thoughts

Obviously, this example can be adapted to similar applications easily by changing the spreadsheet structure, app script code, and Siri Shortcut. Have fun with it!

### Using an NFC tag to launch the shortcut

If you saw my video about this, you know that I used an NFC tag to launch the shortcut. That's totally not required, but can be done by simply setting up an auotmation in Siri Shortcuts to [run your shortcut when a specific NFC tag is detected](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=run+siri+shortcut+when+nfc+detected)

### Note about hardening

As you may have noticed, this is not the most secure approach in the world. Anyone who learns the URL to your webapp could affect the data in your spreadsheet. 

I recommend implementing logic in the requestIsValid_() function to do something additional here to validate that the request is legitimate. I defer to you to decide what you're comfortable with here.
